# Mujeeb-Project-DashBoard
An Automatic Rescue Detection for Vehicle Emergencies 
Mujeeb: Automatic Emergency Response System
Mujeeb is an integrated automatic system designed to detect car accidents through sensors and immediately notify emergency teams using a cloud-connected dashboard platform.
The system operates without artificial intelligence, relying on programmed sensor readings and real-time communication to ensure fast response.

Project Components:
Detection Device:
An Arduino-based device installed in vehicles, equipped with sensors (such as accelerometers and collision detectors) that automatically detect accidents.

Cloud Communication:
Upon detecting an accident, the device instantly sends an alert to a cloud server using GSM or Wi-Fi.

Emergency Dashboard (Web Application):
A React.js-based web dashboard used by emergency responders to monitor and receive accident alerts and view incident details.

Main Objective:
To automate the accident notification process, ensuring quick emergency response and improving post-accident management without the use of AI.

ðŸ”¥ Quick README Summary Version:
Mujeeb Dashboard is a React.js web application that supports the Mujeeb automatic emergency response system by displaying car accident alerts in real-time to emergency teams.
